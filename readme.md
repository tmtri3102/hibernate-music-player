i always be wrong, correct me: so i guess when user go to /songs/demo, controller receive request, create empty Upload object that linked to "upload" which is form has th:object="${upload}". It's like a handshake between controller and the view secretly that "hey we got upload object from views and from controller, if someone submit form then the object with uploaded file will be populated to a full object or bean, and with the file as a property" right, then call UploadFileService to basically combine target folder path with file name so after done controller will move the file to target folder as well as return a page view.html

You're on the right track! Here's a more refined version of your understanding, with a few small corrections:

Request to /songs/demo:
When the user visits /songs/demo, the controller method demo() is invoked. This controller prepares the page by creating an empty Upload object and passing it to the view via mav.addObject("upload", new Upload()).

What happens next: The th:object="${upload}" in the view binds the form to this Upload object. This means that when the form is submitted, Spring will populate this object with the form data (including the uploaded file) automatically.
Form Submission:
When the user submits the form (after selecting a file), Spring processes the request. It uses the DataBinder to map the submitted form data (including the file) to the Upload object that was bound to the form.

What happens next: The form's file field (<input type="file" th:field="*{file}" />) gets populated with the MultipartFile object. This means that the file property of the Upload object now holds the uploaded file.
File Handling in Controller:
After the form is submitted, the controller method upload() is triggered by the @PostMapping("upload"). The Upload object, now populated with the file, is passed to this method.

What happens next: The controller calls UploadFileService.uploadFile(upload.getFile()). This service handles saving the file to the desired folder by combining the target folder path and file name.
Move the File:
In the UploadFileService, the method uploadFile(MultipartFile file) gets the file and saves it to a specific folder using FileCopyUtils.copy(file.getBytes(), new File(folderUpload + fileName)).

Returning the View:
After the file is uploaded, the controller returns a new ModelAndView pointing to view2.html, which could be a page to confirm that the file was uploaded successfully.

Corrected Understanding:
The controller creates an empty Upload object and passes it to the view (th:object="${upload}").
On form submission, Spring binds the form data (including the file) to the Upload object using the DataBinder.
The controller receives the populated Upload object and calls the UploadFileService to save the file to the target folder.
Finally, the controller returns a new view (e.g., view2.html), possibly confirming the file upload.
So yes, you're right about the "handshake" between the controller and view, but the key point is that Spring's DataBinder automatically binds the file and form data to the Upload object without the controller needing to do that manually.
